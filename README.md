# Monitaure

## Introduction

> Monitaure is a smartwatch device embedding multiple sensors. This project has been initiated in 2016 with the desire to design and build a wrist worn device able to locally gather physiological data along the day. Hence it is no longer needed to be connected to any "unknown" third party company web platform to visualize and retrieve the personal health and activity data.

## How it's made ?

>The core processor is an ultra-Low-Power ARM Cortex-M4 100DMIPs microcontroller, chosen for its low power, small but powerful and versatile capabilities.
>It is surrounded by many sensors such as a MAX86150 Sp02 sensor, an infrared TMP007 thermopile for skin temperature reading, a 6-axis BMI270 IMU for gesture recognition and a BME280 environmental sensor for pressure and temperature evaluation.

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

- test
```c
size_t i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {           /* OK */
}
for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i){            /* Wrong */
}
for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i)             /* Wrong */
{
}
```

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
